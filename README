== Description ==

Theme developed for Grace Midtown Community Church. Site can be found at http://midtown.gfc.tv/

== Installation ==

   You may need to preserve the directory structure in the archive when extracting these files. 
   Follow the guidelines provided by your Theme author.
   
2. Using an FTP client to access your host web server, 
   create a directory to save your Theme in the wp-content/themes directory provided by WordPress.

   Your Theme may provide this directory as part of the archive.
   
3. Upload the Theme files to the new directory on your host server.
